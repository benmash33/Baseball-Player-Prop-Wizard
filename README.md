# Baseball Player Prop Wizard

UNFINISHED PRODUCT CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPMENT

# What does this do?

The Baseball Player Prop Wizard is designed to streamline my own personal betting process when I am putting together player prop parlays. My typical process consists of a solid bit of research I will do about the player in question and their matchup for the day. Player prop outcomes are determined by a mix of their season statistics, recent statistics, and a few other components that work into my overall decision-making process.

# Future Plans

Upon completion of the full application itself, I will begin implementing Machine Learning algorithms that will enhance the decision-making process. The ultimate goal of an ML implementation is to create and adjust a weighting system of the different components of the process that will provide better accuracy in the player prop outcomes. As of now, I will be developing my own weighting system for simplicity that reflects the hypothetical weights I assign to the components when I go through my full decision-making process.

# Instructions for executing the code will be provided upon completion of the project
